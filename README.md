# Industrial IOT Motor Control System
This project implements an internet-of-things system for industrial motor control. It allows remote monitoring and control of a high voltage three-phase squirrel cage electric motor over the internet.

### system architecture consists of:

- An ESP32 microcontroller connected to the motor to control and monitor its operation.
- A web application with login authentication where users can view status and send control commands.
- APIs on the backend to interface the web app with the hardware.
- Real-time dashboards displaying motor telemetry data.

### key technologies leveraged are:

- Embedded C++ programming on the ESP32 for IO control and WiFi connectivity.
- Node.js and Express web framework for the backend APIs.
- React and Redux on the frontend for responsive UI development.
- Python Flask for Email verification & OTP
- Socket.IO for real-time motor data streaming.
- JSON Web Tokens for robust user authentication.
